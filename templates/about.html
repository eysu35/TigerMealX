            <p> Campus Dining facilities participating in this program are the Center for Jewish Life, Butler, First, Forbes, Mathey, Rockefeller, and Whitman.</p>
            <p>At a dining hall, students can host multiple students, as long as none of the participants have already dined during that meal period at either a dining hall or a club.</p>
            <p>All residential dining halls participate in the program. Participating clubs are identified prior to the start of the program. The 2 Dickinson Street and Brown co-ops are excluded.</p>
            <p>The following rules apply:</p>
            <p>&bull; Meal exchanges are limited to Sunday dinner through Friday lunch. Other limitations may be imposed by the individual dining facilities.</p>
            <p>&bull; The program accommodates one-for-one exchanges. Both halves of the meal exchange must be completed within 30 days. A reminder for incomplete exchanges will be sent to students 5 days prior to the expiration of the 30 days. A charge is made to the host student if the exchange is not complete.</p>
            <p>&bull; A dinner must be exchanged for a dinner, a lunch for a lunch, and a breakfast for a breakfast.</p>
            <p>&bull; The program can be used only for meals covered by the board contracts of both the guest student and the host student.</p>
            <p>&bull; Students wishing to participate must log into the mobile-friendly website and create an invitation to exchange a meal with a club member. (Club members may invite Campus Dining contract holders.)</p>
            <p>&bull; Meal exchange cannot be used at the Frist Campus Center.</p>
            <p>&bull; Misuse of the program results in a meal charge to the student's account for the corresponding meal.</p>

            <p>This year the program was expanded to include exchanges between eating club members. To see if a club participates and for rules, please contact a club manager.</p>
            <p>Before they can participate, club members must be added to the app by the club managers.</p>
            <p>All questions related to club-to-club exchanges should be directed to a club manager.</p>
